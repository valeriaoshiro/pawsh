# PAWSH

Pawsh is a web app for dog owners. The users are able to enter locations that are dog-friendly. Some of the categories are dog parks, dog-friendly hotels, and restaurants. They are also able to post reviews of each location.

The idea to create Pawsh was born when I was planning a mini vacation in San Diego. I wanted to take my dog, so I started to look for dog-friendly hotels and restaurants.

## Technologies Used:
Ruby on Rails, Paperclip (to upload images), Bcrypt (to sign up and login), Materialize (to style)

## Getting Started:

## Next Steps:
* I want the marker to show information when clicked.
* I want to user to enter locations by name and autocomplete the address
